# SemEval 2020 
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with our team SSN_NLP's code for the OffensEval 2020 Task 12: Offense Target Identification in Social Media. <br> <br>
The original code for fine-tuning and pre-training BERT can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/ThilinaRajapakse/BERT_binary_text_classification) and the datasets are available at the challenge's [OffensEval page](https://sites.google.com/site/offensevalsharedtask/). <br> <br>
We achieved an F1 score of 0.61 over our best run that uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for the purpose of training the OLI model
